      "content": "**Test Cases: Attendance Data Integration (Shoppers Stop to Darwinbox)**\n\n*   **Objective:** Validate the successful integration of attendance data from Shoppers Stop to Darwinbox via API.\n\n*   **General Test Case Requirements:**\n\n    *   All test cases must be executed in a test environment mirroring production.\n    *   Data validation should include checks for data type, format, and range.\n    *   Error handling and logging should be verified for all test cases.\n    *   Performance testing should be conducted to ensure acceptable response times.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Successful Attendance Punch Submission**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that a valid attendance punch from Shoppers Stop is successfully created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send a valid attendance punch payload to the Darwinbox API.\n        2.  Verify that the API returns a success response.\n        3.  Confirm that the attendance record is created in Darwinbox with accurate details (employee ID, timestamp, punch type).\n    *   **Expected Result:** Attendance record created successfully in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 2: Invalid Employee ID**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API rejects attendance punches with invalid employee IDs.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload with an invalid employee ID.\n        2.  Verify that the API returns an error response indicating an invalid employee ID.\n        3.  Confirm that no attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error, and no record is created.\n\n*   **Test Case 3: Missing Required Fields**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API rejects attendance punches with missing required fields (e.g., timestamp).\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload with a missing timestamp.\n        2.  Verify that the API returns an error response indicating missing required fields.\n        3.  Confirm that no attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error, and no record is created.\n\n*   **Test Case 4: Duplicate Attendance Punch**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify the system's handling of duplicate attendance punches.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload.\n        2.  Send the same attendance punch payload again.\n        3.  Verify that the system either rejects the duplicate or updates the existing record based on the defined business logic.\n    *   **Expected Result:** System handles duplicate punches according to defined rules.\n\n*   **Test Case 5: Future-Dated Attendance Punch**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify the system's handling of attendance punches with timestamps in the future.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload with a timestamp in the future.\n        2.  Verify that the API either rejects the punch or processes it according to defined business rules.\n    *   **Expected Result:** System handles future-dated punches according to defined rules.\n\n*   **Test Case 6: High Volume Punch Submission**\n\n    *   **Description:** Simulate a high volume of attendance punches to test system performance and stability.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send 100,000 attendance punches within a short timeframe.\n        2.  Monitor API response times and system resource utilization.\n        3.  Verify that all punches are successfully processed without errors.\n    *   **Expected Result:** System handles high volume without performance degradation or errors.\n\n*   **Test Case 7: Data Type Validation**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API validates data types for each field.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload with an incorrect data type (e.g., string instead of integer).\n        2.  Verify that the API returns an error response indicating a data type mismatch.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error, and no record is created.\n\n*   **Test Case 8: Boundary Value Testing**\n\n    *   **Description:** Test the API with boundary values for numeric fields (e.g., maximum allowed employee ID).\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload with the maximum allowed employee ID.\n        2.  Send an attendance punch payload with an employee ID exceeding the maximum allowed value.\n        3.  Verify that the API accepts the valid value and rejects the invalid value.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API accepts valid boundary values and rejects invalid ones."
