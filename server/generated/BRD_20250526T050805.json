    "Integration Description and Overview": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "*   This is an API-based inbound integration where Shoppers Stop will consume Darwinbox APIs to push attendance punches.\n*   The integration aims to update biometric data in Darwinbox for payroll and performance management purposes.\n*   The scope of this integration is limited to an employee strength of 10,000, with a maximum of 100,000 attendance punches pushed daily.\n*   Data flow is inbound, with data originating from Shoppers Stop and flowing into Darwinbox.\n*   The integration will focus on the Attendance module within Darwinbox.\n*   Shoppers Stop will initiate the data transfer by calling Darwinbox APIs.\n**API-Based Approach:**\n*   Shoppers Stop will use Darwinbox's attendance APIs to push employee attendance punches."
