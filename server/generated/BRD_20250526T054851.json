    "Technical Design Specifications": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Technical Design Specifications\n**Integration Type:** API-Based Inbound (Push)\n**1. Architecture and Approach:**\n*   Shoppers Stop will push attendance punch data to Darwinbox via a REST API.\n*   The integration will utilize a push-based, near real-time approach. Shoppers Stop's system will initiate the data transfer upon attendance punch events.\n*   A dedicated integration layer/service on Shoppers Stop's side will be responsible for:\n    *   Data transformation (if required) to match Darwinbox API specifications.\n    *   API call orchestration.\n    *   Error handling and retry mechanisms.\n    *   Logging and monitoring.\n*   Darwinbox will expose a dedicated API endpoint for receiving attendance punch data.\n*   The integration will be designed to handle a maximum of 100,000 attendance punches per day, considering a maximum employee strength of 10,000.\n**2. API Specifications (Darwinbox - Receiver):**\n*   **API Endpoint:** `/attendance/v1/punches` (Example - subject to Darwinbox API documentation)\n*   **HTTP Method:** POST\n*   **Request Body:** JSON format (Specific schema to be defined by Darwinbox API documentation).\n*   **Authentication:** API Key or OAuth 2.0 (To be determined based on Darwinbox security standards).\n*   **Content Type:** `application/json`\n*   **Response Codes:**\n    *   200 OK: Punch data successfully processed.\n    *   400 Bad Request: Invalid request format or data validation errors.\n    *   401 Unauthorized: Authentication failure.\n    *   500 Internal Server Error: Darwinbox system error.\n*   **Rate Limiting:** Darwinbox to define and enforce appropriate rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure system stability. Shoppers Stop to adhere to these limits.\n**3. Security:**\n*   **Authentication:** API Key or OAuth 2.0 based authentication will be implemented. The chosen method will be based on Darwinbox's security policies.\n*   **Authorization:** Darwinbox will control access to the API endpoint based on the authenticated Shoppers Stop application.\n*   **Data Encryption:** All data transmitted between Shoppers Stop and Darwinbox will be encrypted using HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher).\n*   **API Key Management:** Secure storage and rotation of API keys (if applicable).\n*   **Input Validation:** Darwinbox API will perform thorough input validation to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.\n**4. Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:**\n*   **Error Logging:** Both Shoppers Stop and Darwinbox will implement comprehensive error logging to capture details of failed API calls.\n*   **Retry Mechanism (Shoppers Stop):**\n    *   Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary server unavailability).\n    *   Limit the number of retry attempts to prevent infinite loops.\n    *   Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent overwhelming Darwinbox system during prolonged outages.\n*   **Dead Letter Queue (Shoppers Stop):** For persistent errors (e.g., invalid data), implement a dead letter queue to store failed messages for manual investigation and reprocessing.\n*   **Error Notification:** Shoppers Stop will implement alerting mechanisms to notify relevant stakeholders of integration failures.\n**5. Monitoring and Logging:**\n*   **API Performance Monitoring:** Monitor API response times, error rates, and throughput on both Shoppers Stop and Darwinbox sides.\n*   **Logging:** Detailed logging of API requests, responses, and errors. Include timestamps, request IDs, and relevant data for troubleshooting.\n*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts for critical errors, performance degradation, and security breaches.\n*   **Centralized Logging:** Utilize a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) for efficient log analysis and correlation.\n**6. Data Transformation:**\n*   Shoppers Stop will be responsible for transforming their internal data format to match the Darwinbox API schema.\n*   Transformation logic will be implemented within the Shoppers Stop integration layer.\n*   Data validation will be performed before sending data to Darwinbox.\n**7. Scalability and Performance:**\n*   The integration should be designed to handle the expected volume of 100,000 attendance punches per day.\n*   Darwinbox API should be scalable to accommodate future growth in data volume.\n*   Performance testing will be conducted to ensure that the integration meets performance requirements.\n**8. Deployment:**\n*   The Shoppers Stop integration layer will be deployed in a secure and scalable environment.\n*   Deployment procedures will be documented and tested.\n*   A rollback plan will be in place in case of deployment failures.\n**9. API Versioning:**\n*   Darwinbox will implement API versioning to ensure backward compatibility and minimize disruption during API updates.\n*   Shoppers Stop will adhere to the specified API version.\n**10. Throttling:**\n*   Shoppers Stop will implement throttling mechanism to avoid overwhelming the Darwinbox API with requests.\n*   Throttling limits will be determined based on Darwinbox's API documentation and best practices."
