    "Test Cases": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Test Cases: Shoppers Stop - Darwinbox Attendance Integration**\n\n*   **Test Case Category:** API Integration Testing\n\n*   **Objective:** Validate the successful integration of Shoppers Stop's attendance data into Darwinbox via API.\n\n*   **General Test Case Requirements:**\n\n    *   All test cases must be executed in a dedicated test environment.\n    *   Test data should be representative of real-world Shoppers Stop employee attendance data.\n    *   Each test case should include clear steps, expected results, and actual results.\n    *   Error handling and logging should be validated for all test cases.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Successful Attendance Punch Ingestion**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that a single attendance punch from Shoppers Stop is successfully ingested into Darwinbox.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send a valid attendance punch record to the Darwinbox API.\n        2.  Verify the API response code is 200 OK.\n        3.  Check the Darwinbox Attendance module for the new punch record.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Attendance record is created in Darwinbox with correct employee ID, timestamp, and punch type.\n\n*   **Test Case 2: Invalid Employee ID**\n\n    *   **Description:** Test the system's handling of an attendance punch with an invalid employee ID.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch record with an employee ID that does not exist in Darwinbox.\n        2.  Verify the API response code.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error code (e.g., 400 Bad Request) and an error message indicating the invalid employee ID. No attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 3: Missing Required Fields**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify the system's response when required fields are missing in the attendance punch data.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch record missing a required field (e.g., timestamp).\n        2.  Verify the API response code.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error code (e.g., 400 Bad Request) and an error message indicating the missing required field. No attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 4: Duplicate Attendance Punches**\n\n    *   **Description:** Test the system's handling of duplicate attendance punches.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send the same attendance punch record twice.\n        2.  Verify the API response code for both requests.\n        3.  Check the Darwinbox Attendance module.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The first request is successful (200 OK), and the second request is either rejected with an error message indicating a duplicate record or is handled according to the defined duplicate handling policy. Only one attendance record exists in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 5: High Volume Load Test**\n\n    *   **Description:** Simulate a high volume of attendance punches to assess system performance and stability.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send 100,000 attendance punch records to the Darwinbox API within a defined timeframe.\n        2.  Monitor API response times, error rates, and system resource utilization.\n    *   **Expected Result:** All attendance records are successfully ingested within the defined timeframe. API response times remain within acceptable limits. System resource utilization remains within acceptable thresholds.\n\n*   **Test Case 6: Boundary Value Testing - Timestamp**\n\n    *   **Description:** Test the system's handling of attendance punches with timestamps at the boundaries of acceptable values.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send attendance punches with timestamps at the earliest and latest allowed dates/times.\n        2.  Verify the API response code.\n        3.  Check the Darwinbox Attendance module.\n    *   **Expected Result:** All attendance records are successfully ingested.\n\n*   **Test Case 7: Data Type Validation**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API correctly validates the data types of the incoming attendance punch data.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send attendance punch data with incorrect data types (e.g., a string value for a numeric field).\n        2.  Verify the API response code.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error code (e.g., 400 Bad Request) and an error message indicating the data type mismatch. No attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 8: Time Zone Handling**\n\n    *   **Description:** Validate that the API correctly handles time zone conversions for attendance punches.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send attendance punches with timestamps in different time zones.\n        2.  Verify the API response code.\n        3.  Check the Darwinbox Attendance module to ensure the timestamps are correctly converted to the Darwinbox system time zone.\n    *   **Expected Result:** All attendance records are successfully ingested, and the timestamps are correctly converted to the Darwinbox system time zone.\n\n*   **Test Case 9: API Authentication and Authorization**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API requires proper authentication and authorization.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch record without proper authentication credentials.\n        2.  Verify the API response code.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error code (e.g., 401 Unauthorized) indicating that authentication is required.\n\n*   **Test Case 10: Error Logging and Monitoring**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that all errors are properly logged and monitored.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Execute test cases that are expected to generate errors.\n        2.  Check the API logs and monitoring dashboards.\n    *   **Expected Result:** All errors are logged with sufficient detail for troubleshooting. Monitoring dashboards provide real-time visibility into API health and performance."
