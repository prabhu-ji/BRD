      "type": "text",
      "content": "*   This is an API-Based INBOUND integration where knlkn`knnkn will push employee data to mm nkn.\n\n*   The integration will facilitate the transfer of both active and deactivated employee master data.\n\n*   Data flow is INBOUND, meaning data originates from knlkn`knnkn and is consumed by mm nkn.\n\n*   Business logic dictates that only inactive employee records (date of exit ≥ 1 Jan 2020) and all active employees are synchronized.\n\n*   Implementation will leverage the Core module within mm nkn to manage employee data.\n\n*   Technical implementation will involve knlkn`knnkn pushing data to a designated mm nkn API endpoint, secured with standard authentication protocols (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0)."
