      "content": "*   This document outlines the business requirements and technical details associated with the API-based inbound integration between Tata Motors' biometric attendance system and Darwinbox. This integration enables Tata Motors to leverage their existing biometric infrastructure for attendance tracking.\n*   The integration facilitates the seamless transfer of attendance data from Tata Motors to Darwinbox, ensuring accurate and timely updates for payroll processing, performance management, and other related HR functions. This push-based approach allows for near real-time data synchronization.\n*   By utilizing Darwinbox APIs, Tata Motors can directly push attendance punches into the system, streamlining the data flow and reducing manual intervention. The scope of this integration is initially limited to 10,000 employees, with an expected volume of 100,000 attendance punches per day."
