Verify the API response.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   Attendance punch is not recorded in Darwinbox.\n        *   An error message is logged in the Darwinbox system indicating the missing required field.\n\n*   **Test Case 6: Data Type Validation**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system validates the data types of the attendance punch fields.\n    *   **Pre-conditions:**\n        *   None\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends an attendance punch with an invalid data type (e.g., a string in a numeric field).\n        2.  Verify the API response.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   Attendance punch is not recorded in Darwinbox.\n        *   An error message is logged in the Darwinbox system indicating the invalid data type.\n\n*   **Test Case 7: API Authentication**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API authentication mechanism is working correctly.\n    *   **Pre-conditions:**\n        *   API credentials are valid.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends an attendance punch with valid API credentials.\n        2.  Shoppers Stop system sends an attendance punch with invalid API credentials.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   Valid credentials: Attendance punch is processed successfully.\n        *   Invalid credentials: API request is rejected with an appropriate error message (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).\n\n*   **Test Case 8: Time Zone Handling**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system correctly handles time zones.\n    *   **Pre-conditions:**\n        *   Shoppers Stop and Darwinbox are in different time zones.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.
