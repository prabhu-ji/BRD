      "type": "text",
      "content": "*   This document outlines the business requirements and technical details associated with the API-based inbound integration between Tata Motors' biometric attendance system and Darwinbox. This integration will enable Tata Motors to seamlessly update employee attendance data within Darwinbox for payroll, performance management, and other related processes.\n*   The integration leverages a push-based API approach, allowing Tata Motors to transmit attendance punches directly to Darwinbox. This real-time data flow ensures accurate and up-to-date attendance records, improving operational efficiency and data integrity."

    "Integration Description and Overview": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "*   This will be a push-based integration, Tata Motors needs to consume Darwinbox APIs to push the attendance punches. The scope of this integration will be limited to the employee strength of 10,000 (considering that maximum 1,00,000 attendance punches will be pushed in a day).\n*   Tata Motors will use its biometric system to record employee attendance data.\n*   The integration will enable Tata Motors to push attendance punches into the Darwinbox Attendance module via APIs.\n*   This INBOUND integration will allow Darwinbox to receive attendance data from Tata Motors.\n*   The integration will support near real-time updates of attendance data in Darwinbox.\n*   Tata Motors will act as the data source, pushing attendance punches to Darwinbox."

    "Technical Design Specifications": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "*   Tata Motors pushes attendance data to Darwinbox via API.\n*   Darwinbox validates and processes the attendance punches.\n*   Processed data updates the Attendance module in Darwinbox.\n*   A confirmation response is sent back to Tata Motors.\n*   Tata Motors' biometric system sends attendance punches to Darwinbox.\n*   The integration supports up to 100,000 attendance punches daily."
