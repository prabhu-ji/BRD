Performance Test Cases**\n\n*   **TC_SS_DB_ATT_013: Load Testing**\n\n    *   Simulate a high volume of attendance punch submissions (e.g., 100,000 punches per day).\n    *   Monitor the API response time and system performance to ensure it meets the defined SLAs.\n\n*   **TC_SS_DB_ATT_014: Stress Testing**\n\n    *   Gradually increase the volume of attendance punch submissions to identify the breaking point of the system.\n    *   Monitor the API response time, system resource utilization, and error rates.\n\n**IV. Security Test Cases**\n\n*   **TC_SS_DB_ATT_015: Authentication and Authorization**\n\n    *   Verify that Shoppers Stop's API credentials are valid and authorized to submit attendance punches.\n    *   Attempt to submit punches with invalid or unauthorized credentials.\n    *   API Response Code: 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden.\n\n*   **TC_SS_DB_ATT_016: Data Encryption**\n\n    *   Ensure that attendance data is encrypted during transmission between Shoppers Stop and Darwinbox.\n    *   Verify that the encryption protocol meets the defined security standards."
