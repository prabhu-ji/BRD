      "content": "*   This document outlines the business requirements defined by Shopper Stop and technical details associated with the Biometric integration using API approach defined by the Darwinbox Integrations team to facilitate seamless data transfer between Shopper Stop and Darwinbox.\n*   This integration will enable Shopper Stop to push attendance punches into Darwinbox, leveraging biometric data for payroll processing and performance management. The integration is designed as an INBOUND data flow, with Shopper Stop as the source system."

    "Integration Description and Overview": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "*   This is an API-based inbound integration where Shopper Stop will push employee attendance punches to Darwinbox.\n*   Shopper Stop will consume Darwinbox APIs to push attendance data.\n*   **Data Flow:** INBOUND - Attendance punches flow from Shopper Stop to Darwinbox.\n*   **Business Logic:** This will be a push-based integration, ShoppersStop needs to consume Darwinbox APIs to push the attendance punches. The scope of this integration will be limited to the employee strength of 10,000 (considering that maximum 1,00,000 attendance punches will be pushed in a day)\n*   **Module:** Attendance module in Darwinbox will be updated with the attendance punches.\n*   **Authentication:** Standard API authentication methods (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) will be used to secure the integration."

Purpose/Overview**\n\n*   This document outlines the technical specifications for the API-based inbound integration between Shopper Stop and for the Attendance module.\n*   Shopper Stop will push attendance punches to Darwinbox.\n*   This integration supports Shopper Stop's need to use biometric data for payroll and performance management.\n\n**2. APIs Used**\n\n*   Attendance API:\n    *   Endpoint: `/api/v1/attendance/punches` (Example - actual endpoint to be confirmed)\n    *   Method: `POST`\n    *   Authentication: API Key (To be generated and securely shared with Shopper Stop)\n    *   Request Body: JSON format containing employee ID, punch timestamp, punch type (IN/OUT), and device ID.\n\n**3. Technical Specifications**\n\n*   **Integration Mode:** API-Based, INBOUND (Shopper Stop to ).\n*   **Data Format:** JSON.\n*   **Transport Protocol:** HTTPS.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   API Key authentication.\n    *   Data encryption in transit (HTTPS).\n*   **Error Handling:**\n    *   `Darwinbox` will return appropriate HTTP status codes for successful and failed requests.\n    *   Shopper Stop should implement retry logic for failed requests.\n*   **Rate Limiting:**\n    *   `Darwinbox` will implement rate limiting to protect the API from abuse.\n    *   Shopper Stop should adhere to the rate limits specified by `Darwinbox`.\n*   **Data Volume:** Supports up to 100,000 attendance punches per day.\n*   **Employee Strength:** Designed for an employee strength of 10,000.\n\n**4. Data Mapping**\n\n*   Shopper Stop Field: Employee ID -> Darwinbox Field: Employee ID\n*   Shopper Stop Field: Punch Timestamp -> Darwinbox Field: Attendance Timestamp\n*   Shopper Stop Field: Punch Type (IN/OUT) -> Darwinbox Field: Attendance Type\n*   Shopper Stop Field: Device ID -> Darwinbox Field: Device ID\n\n**5. Integration Flow**\n\n1.  Shopper Stop captures employee attendance punches.\n2.  Shopper Stop transforms the data into the required JSON format.\n3.  Shopper Stop sends the attendance data to the `/api/v1/attendance/punches` endpoint using the `POST` method.\n4.  `Darwinbox` validates the data and creates attendance records.\n5.  `Darwinbox` returns a success or error response to Shopper Stop.\n\n**6. Dependencies/Assumptions**\n\n*   Shopper Stop has a stable internet connection.\n*   Shopper Stop has the technical capability to consume REST APIs.\n*   Shopper Stop will manage and secure the API Key provided by `Darwinbox`.\n*   Employee IDs are unique and consistent between Shopper Stop and .\n*   Shopper Stop will adhere to `Darwinbox`'s API rate limits.\n*   Attendance module is enabled in ."
