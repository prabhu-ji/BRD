      "content": "**Test Cases: Shoppers Stop - Darwinbox Attendance Integration**\n\n*   **Objective:** Validate the successful integration of Shoppers Stop's attendance data into Darwinbox via API.\n\n*   **General Test Case Requirements:**\n\n    *   All test cases must be executed in a test environment mirroring production.\n    *   Test data should include a representative sample of Shoppers Stop employees.\n    *   Each test case must document the expected results and actual results.\n    *   Any discrepancies between expected and actual results must be documented as defects.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Successful Attendance Punch Submission**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that a valid attendance punch from Shoppers Stop is successfully ingested into Darwinbox.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends a valid attendance punch to the Darwinbox API endpoint.\n        2.  The attendance punch includes required fields (Employee ID, Timestamp, Punch Type).\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   Darwinbox successfully receives and processes the attendance punch.\n        *   The attendance record is created in the Darwinbox Attendance module.\n        *   API returns a success response (HTTP 200 OK).\n    *   **Data:**\n        *   Employee ID: Valid Darwinbox Employee ID\n        *   Timestamp: Current timestamp\n        *   Punch Type: IN\n\n*   **Test Case 2: Invalid Employee ID**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system rejects attendance punches with invalid Employee IDs.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends an attendance punch with an invalid Employee ID.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   Darwinbox rejects the attendance punch.\n        *   API returns an error response (HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n        *   Error message indicates \"Invalid Employee ID\".\n    *   **Data:**\n        *   Employee ID: Invalid Employee ID\n        *   Timestamp: Current timestamp\n        *   Punch Type: OUT\n\n*   **Test Case 3: Missing Required Fields**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system rejects attendance punches with missing required fields.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends an attendance punch missing the Timestamp field.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   Darwinbox rejects the attendance punch.\n        *   API returns an error response (HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n        *   Error message indicates \"Missing required field: Timestamp\".\n    *   **Data:**\n        *   Employee ID: Valid Darwinbox Employee ID\n        *   Punch Type: IN\n\n*   **Test Case 4: Duplicate Attendance Punch**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system handles duplicate attendance punches appropriately.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends the same attendance punch twice within a short time frame.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   Darwinbox processes the first attendance punch.\n        *   Darwinbox rejects the second attendance punch as a duplicate.\n        *   API returns an error response (HTTP 409 Conflict) for the duplicate punch.\n    *   **Data:**\n        *   Employee ID: Valid Darwinbox Employee ID\n        *   Timestamp: Specific timestamp\n        *   Punch Type: IN\n\n*   **Test Case 5: High Volume Load Test**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify the system's performance under high load conditions.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Simulate 100,000 attendance punches being sent from Shoppers Stop to Darwinbox within a 24-hour period.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   Darwinbox successfully processes all attendance punches without significant performance degradation.\n        *   API response times remain within acceptable limits (e.g., < 1 second).\n        *   No system errors or failures occur.\n\n*   **Test Case 6: Data Type Validation**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system validates the data types of the incoming attendance punch data.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends an attendance punch with an invalid data type for the Timestamp field (e.g., a string instead of a timestamp).\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   Darwinbox rejects the attendance punch.\n        *   API returns an error response (HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n        *   Error message indicates \"Invalid data type for field: Timestamp\".\n    *   **Data:**\n        *   Employee ID: Valid Darwinbox Employee ID\n        *   Timestamp: \"Invalid Timestamp\"\n        *   Punch Type: OUT\n\n*   **Test Case 7: API Authentication Failure**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system rejects requests with invalid API credentials.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends an attendance punch with incorrect API credentials (e.g., invalid API key).\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   Darwinbox rejects the request.\n        *   API returns an error response (HTTP 401 Unauthorized).\n        *   Error message indicates \"Invalid API credentials\".\n\n*   **Test Case 8: Timezone Handling**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system correctly handles attendance punches from different timezones.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends attendance punches with timestamps in different timezones.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   Darwinbox correctly converts all timestamps to the Darwinbox system timezone.\n        *   Attendance records are created with the correct time in the Darwinbox system timezone.\n    *   **Data:**\n        *   Employee ID: Valid Darwinbox Employee ID\n        *   Timestamp: Timestamps in various timezones (e.g., UTC, IST, PST)\n        *   Punch Type: IN/OUT"
