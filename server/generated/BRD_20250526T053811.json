Shoppers Stop pushes a new attendance record to darwinbox API.\n            2.  Verify the record is created in darwinbox with correct details.\n        *   **Expected Result:** Attendance record created successfully in darwinbox.\n    *   **Scenario 2: Invalid Employee ID**\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Shoppers Stop pushes an attendance record with an invalid employee ID.\n            2.  Verify that the API returns an appropriate error message.\n        *   **Expected Result:** Error message indicating invalid employee ID.\n    *   **Scenario 3: Missing Required Fields**\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Shoppers Stop pushes an attendance record with missing required fields (e.g., punch-in time).\n            2.  Verify that the API returns an error message indicating missing fields.\n        *   **Expected Result:** Error message indicating missing required fields.\n    *   **Scenario 4: Data Type Validation**\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Shoppers Stop pushes an attendance record with incorrect data types (e.g., string in a numeric field).\n            2.  Verify that the API returns an error message indicating data type mismatch.\n        *   **Expected Result:** Error message indicating data type mismatch.\n    *   **Scenario 5: High Volume Data Load**\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Simulate a high volume of attendance punches (e.g., 100,000) being pushed to the darwinbox API.\n            2.  Monitor API response times and system performance.\n        *   **Expected Result:** API handles the load without significant performance degradation.\n    *   **Scenario 6: API Authentication Failure**\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Attempt to access the darwinbox API with invalid credentials.\n            2.  Verify that the API returns an authentication error.\n        *   **Expected Result:** Authentication error.\n    *   **Scenario 7: Data Encryption**\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Capture the data transmitted between Shoppers Stop and darwinbox.\n            2.  Verify that the data is encrypted during transmission.\n        *   **Expected Result:** Data is encrypted.\n    *   **Scenario 8: Retry Mechanism**\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Simulate a temporary API failure.\n            2.  Verify that Shoppers Stop's system retries the API call.\n            3.  Verify that the data is eventually successfully transferred to darwinbox.\n        *   **Expected Result:** Data is successfully transferred after retry.\n    *   **Scenario 9: Time Zone Handling**\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Shoppers Stop pushes attendance data with a specific time zone.\n            2.  Verify that the time zone is correctly converted and stored in darwinbox.\n        *   **Expected Result:** Time zone is correctly handled.\n\n*   **Data Validation:**\n\n    *   Verify that all required fields are present.\n    *   Validate data types for each field.\n    *   Confirm data accuracy against source data in Shoppers Stop.\n    *   Check for duplicate records.\n\n*   **API Documentation Verification:**\n\n    *   Verify that the API documentation is accurate and up-to-date.\n    *   Confirm that the API documentation includes all necessary information for Shoppers Stop to integrate successfully."
