      "content": "**Test Cases: Attendance Data Integration (Shoppers Stop to Darwinbox)**\n\n*   **Objective:** Validate the successful integration of attendance data from Shoppers Stop to Darwinbox via API.\n\n*   **General Test Case Requirements:**\n\n    *   All test cases must be executed in a test environment mirroring the production environment.\n    *   Each test case must include clear steps, expected results, and actual results.\n    *   Test data should include a variety of scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.\n    *   All tests must be documented with pass/fail status and any relevant observations.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Successful Attendance Punch Submission**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that a valid attendance punch from Shoppers Stop is successfully recorded in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends a valid attendance punch to the Darwinbox API endpoint.\n        2.  The attendance punch includes employee ID, timestamp, and punch type (IN/OUT).\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   The Darwinbox API returns a success response (HTTP 200 OK).\n        *   The attendance record is created in Darwinbox with the correct employee ID, timestamp, and punch type.\n    *   **Data Requirements:**\n        *   Valid Employee ID existing in Darwinbox.\n        *   Timestamp within acceptable range.\n        *   Valid punch type (e.g., \"IN\", \"OUT\").\n\n*   **Test Case 2: Invalid Employee ID**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system handles an attendance punch with an invalid employee ID gracefully.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends an attendance punch with an employee ID that does not exist in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   The Darwinbox API returns an error response (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request or HTTP 404 Not Found).\n        *   The error response includes a clear message indicating that the employee ID is invalid.\n        *   No attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 3: Missing Required Fields**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system handles an attendance punch with missing required fields.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends an attendance punch missing the timestamp field.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   The Darwinbox API returns an error response (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n        *   The error response includes a clear message indicating which required field is missing.\n        *   No attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 4: Duplicate Attendance Punch**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system handles duplicate attendance punches correctly.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends the same attendance punch twice within a short time frame.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   The Darwinbox API handles the duplicate punch according to the defined business rules (e.g., ignore the duplicate, update the existing record).\n        *   The system logs the duplicate punch attempt.\n\n*   **Test Case 5: High Volume Data Load**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify the system's performance under a high volume of attendance punches.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends 100,000 attendance punches to the Darwinbox API within a 24-hour period.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   All attendance punches are successfully processed within the agreed-upon SLA.\n        *   The system performance remains stable and does not degrade significantly.\n\n*   **Test Case 6: Timestamp Validation**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system validates the timestamp of the attendance punch.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends an attendance punch with a timestamp that is significantly in the past or future.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   The Darwinbox API returns an error response if the timestamp is outside the acceptable range.\n        *   The error response includes a clear message indicating that the timestamp is invalid.\n        *   No attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 7: API Authentication Failure**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the Darwinbox API rejects requests with invalid authentication credentials.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends an attendance punch with incorrect API credentials.\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   The Darwinbox API returns an authentication error (e.g., HTTP 401 Unauthorized).\n        *   The system logs the authentication failure attempt.\n\n*   **Test Case 8: Data Type Validation**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the Darwinbox API validates the data types of the incoming attendance data.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Shoppers Stop system sends an attendance punch with an invalid data type for the employee ID field (e.g., a string instead of an integer).\n    *   **Expected Result:**\n        *   The Darwinbox API returns an error response (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n        *   The error response includes a clear message indicating the data type validation failure.\n        *   No attendance record is created in Darwinbox."
