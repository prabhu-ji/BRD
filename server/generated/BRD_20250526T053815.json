      "content": "*   This is an API-Based INBOUND integration between Shoppers Stop and Darwinbox.\n*   The integration aims to update biometric attendance data for Shoppers Stop employees within Darwinbox. This data will be used for payroll and performance management purposes.\n*   Shoppers Stop will consume Darwinbox APIs to push attendance punches.\n*   The scope of this integration is limited to 10,000 employees, with an estimated maximum of 100,000 attendance punches pushed daily.\n*   Data will flow INBOUND to Darwinbox, specifically updating the Attendance module.\n*   This is a push-based integration initiated by Shoppers Stop.\n**API-Based Approach:**\n*   Shoppers Stop will use Darwinbox's exposed APIs to transmit attendance data."
