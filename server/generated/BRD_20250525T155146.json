      "content": "**Test Cases: Attendance Data Integration (Shoppers Stop to Darwinbox)**\n\n*   **Objective:** Validate the successful integration of attendance data from Shoppers Stop to Darwinbox via API.\n\n*   **General Test Case Requirements:**\n\n    *   All test cases must be executed in a test environment mirroring production.\n    *   Data validation must include checks for data type, format, and completeness.\n    *   Error handling and logging must be verified for all test cases.\n    *   Performance testing should be conducted to ensure acceptable response times.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Successful Attendance Punch Submission**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that a valid attendance punch from Shoppers Stop is successfully created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit a valid attendance punch record via the API.\n        2.  Verify the record is created in Darwinbox with correct details (employee ID, timestamp, punch type).\n    *   **Expected Result:** Attendance record created successfully in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 2: Invalid Employee ID**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API rejects attendance punches with invalid employee IDs.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch with an employee ID that does not exist in Darwinbox.\n        2.  Verify the API returns an appropriate error message.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error indicating an invalid employee ID.\n\n*   **Test Case 3: Missing Required Fields**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API rejects attendance punches with missing required fields.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch with missing required fields (e.g., timestamp).\n        2.  Verify the API returns an appropriate error message.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error indicating missing required fields.\n\n*   **Test Case 4: Duplicate Attendance Punch**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify the system handles duplicate attendance punches appropriately.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch.\n        2.  Submit the same attendance punch again.\n        3.  Verify that the system either rejects the duplicate or updates the existing record (depending on business rules).\n    *   **Expected Result:** System handles duplicate punches according to defined business rules.\n\n*   **Test Case 5: Future-Dated Attendance Punch**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API handles future-dated attendance punches according to defined rules.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch with a timestamp in the future.\n        2.  Verify that the system either rejects the punch or processes it according to defined rules.\n    *   **Expected Result:** System handles future-dated punches according to defined business rules.\n\n*   **Test Case 6: High Volume Load Test**\n\n    *   **Description:** Simulate a high volume of attendance punches to assess system performance and stability.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit 100,000 attendance punches within a defined timeframe.\n        2.  Monitor system performance (response time, CPU usage, memory usage).\n        3.  Verify that all punches are processed successfully.\n    *   **Expected Result:** System processes all punches successfully within acceptable performance parameters.\n\n*   **Test Case 7: Data Type Validation**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API validates data types for all fields.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch with incorrect data types (e.g., string in a numeric field).\n        2.  Verify that the API returns an appropriate error message.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error indicating incorrect data type.\n\n*   **Test Case 8: Timestamp Format Validation**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API validates the timestamp format.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch with an invalid timestamp format.\n        2.  Verify that the API returns an appropriate error message.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error indicating invalid timestamp format.\n\n*   **Test Case 9: API Authentication**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API requires valid authentication credentials.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch without valid authentication credentials.\n        2.  Verify that the API returns an authentication error.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an authentication error.\n\n*   **Test Case 10: Concurrent API Requests**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API handles concurrent requests without errors.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit multiple attendance punches concurrently from different sources.\n        2.  Verify that all punches are processed successfully without data corruption or errors.\n    *   **Expected Result:** All concurrent requests are processed successfully."
