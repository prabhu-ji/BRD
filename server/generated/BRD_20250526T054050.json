Positive Test Cases:**\n\n*   **TC_ATT_001: Successful Punch Submission**\n\n    *   Verify that a single attendance punch from Shoppers Stop is successfully recorded in darwinbox.\n    *   Validate data accuracy (employee ID, timestamp, punch type).\n\n*   **TC_ATT_002: Multiple Punches for Single Employee**\n\n    *   Verify that multiple punches for a single employee on the same day are correctly recorded.\n    *   Validate sequence and timestamp accuracy.\n\n*   **TC_ATT_003: Large Data Volume Submission**\n\n    *   Verify that 10,000 employee attendance punches are successfully processed within acceptable time limits.\n    *   Monitor system performance and resource utilization.\n\n*   **TC_ATT_004: Valid Employee ID**\n\n    *   Verify that punches with valid employee IDs existing in darwinbox are successfully processed.\n\n*   **TC_ATT_005: Correct Timestamp Format**\n\n    *   Verify that punches with the correct timestamp format are successfully processed.\n\n**II. Negative Test Cases:**\n\n*   **TC_ATT_006: Invalid Employee ID**\n\n    *   Verify that punches with invalid employee IDs are rejected and an appropriate error message is returned.\n\n*   **TC_ATT_007: Incorrect Timestamp Format**\n\n    *   Verify that punches with an incorrect timestamp format are rejected and an appropriate error message is returned.\n\n*   **TC_ATT_008: Duplicate Punch Submission**\n\n    *   Verify that duplicate punch submissions are handled appropriately (either rejected or updated, based on business rules).\n\n*   **TC_ATT_009: Missing Required Fields**\n\n    *   Verify that punches with missing required fields (e.g., employee ID, timestamp) are rejected and an appropriate error message is returned.\n\n*   **TC_ATT_010: Future Timestamp**\n\n    *   Verify that punches with timestamps in the future are rejected and an appropriate error message is returned.\n\n*   **TC_ATT_011: Exceeding Daily Punch Limit**\n\n    *   Verify that if a configured daily punch limit is exceeded, the system responds appropriately (e.g., rejects further punches, sends an alert).\n\n**III. Error Handling and Logging:**\n\n*   **TC_ATT_012: Error Logging**\n\n    *   Verify that all errors encountered during the integration process are logged with sufficient detail for troubleshooting.\n\n*   **TC_ATT_013: Error Notification**\n\n    *   Verify that appropriate notifications are sent to the integration team when errors occur.\n\n**IV. Performance Testing:**\n\n*   **TC_ATT_014: API Response Time**\n\n    *   Measure the API response time for various data volumes.\n    *   Ensure response times are within acceptable limits.\n\n*   **TC_ATT_015: Throughput**\n\n    *   Measure the throughput of the integration (number of punches processed per unit of time).\n    *   Ensure throughput meets the required performance criteria.\n\n**V. Security Testing:**\n\n*   **TC_ATT_016: Authentication and Authorization**\n\n    *   Verify that only authorized systems (Shoppers Stop) can access the darwinbox API.\n    *   Validate authentication mechanisms.\n\n*   **TC_ATT_017: Data Encryption**\n\n    *   Verify that data is encrypted during transmission.\n\n**VI. Data Validation:**\n\n*   **TC_ATT_018: Data Integrity**\n\n    *   Verify that the data in darwinbox matches the data sent from Shoppers Stop.\n\n*   **TC_ATT_019: Data Type Validation**\n\n    *   Verify that data types are correctly validated (e.g., employee ID is a string, timestamp is a date/time)."
