The record is not created in Darwinbox.\n        *   Data Points:\n            *   Employee ID: Valid Shoppers Stop Employee ID with special characters\n            *   Timestamp: Current date and time\n            *   Punch Type: OUT\n\n**II. Performance Test Cases**\n\n*   **Objective:** Evaluate the API's performance under load.\n\n    *   **Test Case 7: Single Punch Performance**\n        *   Scenario: Send a single attendance punch.\n        *   Expected Result: API response time is within acceptable limits (e.g., < 200ms).\n    *   **Test Case 8: Batch Processing (1000 Punches)**\n        *   Scenario: Send a batch of 1000 attendance punches.\n        *   Expected Result: API processes the batch within acceptable limits (e.g., < 5 seconds).\n    *   **Test Case 9: Stress Test (10,000 Punches)**\n        *   Scenario: Send a batch of 10,000 attendance punches.\n        *   Expected Result: API processes the batch without errors and within acceptable limits.\n\n**III. Error Handling Test Cases**\n\n*   **Objective:** Verify proper error handling by the API.\n\n    *   **Test Case 10: API Down**\n        *   Scenario: Darwinbox API is temporarily unavailable.\n        *   Expected Result: Shoppers Stop system receives an appropriate error response and implements retry logic or alerts.\n    *   **Test Case 11: Invalid API Key**\n        *   Scenario: Shoppers Stop uses an invalid API key.\n        *   Expected Result: The API returns an authentication error.\n    *   **Test Case 12: Rate Limiting**\n        *   Scenario: Shoppers Stop exceeds the API rate limit.\n        *   Expected Result: The API returns a rate limiting error. Shoppers Stop implements backoff strategy.\n\n**IV. Security Test Cases**\n\n*   **Objective:** Validate the security of the API integration.\n\n    *   **Test Case 13: Data Encryption**\n        *   Scenario: Verify that data is encrypted in transit (e.g., using HTTPS).\n        *   Expected Result: Data is transmitted securely using HTTPS.\n    *   **Test Case 14: Authorization**\n        *   Scenario: Attempt to access the API without proper authorization.\n        *   Expected Result: The API returns an authorization error.\n\n**V.
