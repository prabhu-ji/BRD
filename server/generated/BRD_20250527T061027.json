      "type": "text",
      "content": "*   This document outlines the business requirements defined by Shopper Stop and technical details associated with the Biometric integration using API approach defined by the Darwinbox Integrations team to facilitate the transfer of attendance data to Darwinbox.\n*   Shopper Stop will use this biometric data pushed via APIs for payroll processing and performance management within Darwinbox.\n*   This INBOUND integration ensures accurate and timely attendance information is available in Darwinbox, supporting critical HR processes."
    },
    "Integration Description and Overview": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "*   This is an API-based inbound integration where Shopper Stop will push employee attendance punches to Darwinbox.\n*   Shopper Stop will consume Darwinbox APIs to push attendance data.\n*   **Data Flow:** INBOUND - Attendance punches flow from Shopper Stop to Darwinbox.\n*   **Business Logic:** This will be a push-based integration, ShoppersStop needs to consume Darwinbox APIs to push the attendance punches. The scope of this integration will be limited to the employee strength of 10,000 (considering that maximum 1,00,000 attendance punches will be pushed in a day)\n*   **Module:** Attendance module in Darwinbox will be updated with the attendance punches from Shopper Stop.\n*   Standard API authentication and authorization mechanisms will be implemented to ensure secure data transfer."

      "content": "**Technical Design Specifications**\n*   Shopper Stop pushes attendance data to Darwinbox via API.\n*   Darwinbox processes data for payroll and performance management.\n**API Specifications**\n*   API Mode: Push-based.\n*   Data Direction: Inbound (Shopper Stop to Darwinbox)."
    },
    "Assumptions": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "*   Shopper Stop will ensure the accuracy and completeness of the biometric attendance data before pushing it to Darwinbox.\n*   Shopper Stop's system will be available and responsive during the scheduled integration windows.\n*   Employee IDs provided by Shopper Stop will be valid and active in Darwinbox.\n*   Shopper Stop will adhere to Darwinbox API rate limits and usage guidelines.\n*   Shopper Stop will handle any data transformations required to map their data to Darwinbox's Attendance API schema.\n*   Shopper Stop will provide necessary authentication credentials for accessing Darwinbox APIs.\n*   Shopper Stop will maintain a stable network connection for reliable data transfer.\n*   Shopper Stop will notify Darwinbox of any changes to their biometric data collection process that may impact the integration.\n*   Darwinbox's Attendance module is configured to accept attendance punches from external systems.\n*   Darwinbox's API endpoints for attendance data ingestion are available and functioning as expected.\n*   Darwinbox will provide Shopper Stop with timely support for any integration-related issues."

    "Dependencies": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "-   Shopper Stop must have the necessary infrastructure to support API calls to Darwinbox. This includes network connectivity and firewall configurations.\n-   Shopper Stop's system must be able to handle the expected volume of attendance punches (up to 100,000 per day for 10,000 employees).\n-   API Access and Authentication:\n    -   Shopper Stop requires valid API credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens) to access Darwinbox's Attendance APIs.\n    -   The authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth 2.0) must be implemented correctly on Shopper Stop's end.\n-   Data Validation and Mapping:\n    -   Shopper Stop must map its attendance data fields to the corresponding fields in Darwinbox's Attendance API.\n    -   Data validation rules must be implemented to ensure data accuracy and consistency before pushing data to Darwinbox."
