    "Integration Description and Overview": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "*   This is an API-Based INBOUND integration between Shoppers Stop and darwinbox.\n*   The integration's primary purpose is to update employee biometric data within darwinbox for payroll and performance management purposes.\n*   Shoppers Stop will consume darwinbox APIs to push attendance punches.\n*   The integration scope is limited to 10,000 employees, with an estimated maximum of 100,000 attendance punches pushed daily.\n*   The darwinbox Attendance module will be the recipient of the data.\n*   Data flow is INBOUND, originating from Shoppers Stop and directed into darwinbox.\n**API-Based Approach:**\n*   Shoppers Stop will act as the API client, initiating requests to darwinbox."

Shoppers Stop system pushes a single attendance punch for an existing employee to the darwinbox API.\n            2.  Verify successful API response (HTTP 200 OK).\n            3.  Verify the attendance punch is recorded accurately in the darwinbox Attendance module.\n            4.  Validate the punch time, employee ID, and other relevant details.\n\n    *   **TC_ATT_002: Invalid Employee ID**\n\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Shoppers Stop system pushes an attendance punch with an invalid employee ID.\n            2.  Verify the API returns an appropriate error code (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n            3.  Verify the error message clearly indicates the invalid employee ID.\n            4.  Verify no attendance record is created in darwinbox.\n\n    *   **TC_ATT_003: Missing Required Fields**\n\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Shoppers Stop system pushes an attendance punch with missing required fields (e.g., timestamp).\n            2.  Verify the API returns an appropriate error code (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n            3.  Verify the error message identifies the missing field(s).\n            4.  Verify no attendance record is created in darwinbox.\n\n    *   **TC_ATT_004: Duplicate Attendance Punch**\n\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Shoppers Stop system pushes the same attendance punch twice within a short timeframe.\n            2.  Verify the darwinbox system handles the duplicate punch appropriately (e.g., ignores the second punch or updates the existing record).\n            3.  Verify data integrity and avoid creating multiple identical records.\n\n    *   **TC_ATT_005: Attendance Punch Outside Valid Range**\n\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Shoppers Stop system pushes an attendance punch with a timestamp outside the allowed range (e.g., future date).\n            2.  Verify the API returns an appropriate error code or warning.\n            3.  Verify the attendance record is handled according to the defined business rules (e.g., rejected or flagged for review).\n\n    *   **TC_ATT_006: Bulk Attendance Punch Submission**\n\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Shoppers Stop system pushes a batch of 100 attendance punches for different employees.\n            2.  Verify successful API response (HTTP 200 OK).\n            3.  Verify all attendance punches are recorded accurately in the darwinbox Attendance module.\n            4.  Validate the punch times, employee IDs, and other relevant details for all records.\n\n    *   **TC_ATT_007: API Rate Limiting**\n\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Shoppers Stop system exceeds the defined API rate limit.\n            2.  Verify the API returns an appropriate error code (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests).\n            3.  Verify the error message indicates the rate limit exceeded.\n            4.  Verify the Shoppers Stop system implements appropriate retry logic.\n\n    *   **TC_ATT_008: Data Type Validation**\n\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Shoppers Stop system sends attendance data with incorrect data types (e.g., string instead of integer).\n            2.  Verify the API returns an appropriate error code (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n            3.  Verify the error message clearly indicates the data type mismatch.\n            4.  Verify no attendance record is created in darwinbox.\n\n    *   **TC_ATT_009: Time Zone Handling**\n\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Shoppers Stop system sends attendance punches with different time zones.\n            2.  Verify darwinbox correctly converts and stores the attendance times in the appropriate time zone.\n            3.  Validate the time zone conversion logic.\n\n    *   **TC_ATT_010: Large Volume Testing**\n\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Shoppers Stop system pushes 100,000 attendance punches in a simulated production load.\n            2.  Monitor API performance and response times.\n            3.  Verify data integrity and accuracy of all records.\n            4.  Identify any performance bottlenecks.\n\n*   **Expected Results:**\n\n    *   Successful data transfer and accurate record creation in darwinbox.\n    *   Appropriate error handling and logging for invalid data or system errors.\n    *   API performance within defined SLAs.\n    *   Data integrity and consistency across both systems."
