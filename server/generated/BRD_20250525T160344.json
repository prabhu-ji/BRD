Successful Data Transfer Test Cases:**\n\n*   **TC_ATT_001: Single Attendance Punch Success**\n    *   Objective: Verify a single attendance punch is successfully transferred and recorded in Darwinbox.\n    *   Steps:\n        1.  Shoppers Stop sends a single attendance punch record via API.\n        2.  Darwinbox receives and processes the record.\n    *   Expected Result: Attendance record is created in Darwinbox with correct details (employee ID, timestamp, punch type).\n\n*   **TC_ATT_002: Multiple Attendance Punches Success**\n    *   Objective: Verify multiple attendance punches are successfully transferred and recorded in Darwinbox.\n    *   Steps:\n        1.  Shoppers Stop sends a batch of 10 attendance punch records via API.\n        2.
