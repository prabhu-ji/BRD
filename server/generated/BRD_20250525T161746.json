Send a valid attendance punch payload to the darwinbox API.\n        2.  Verify the API response returns a success code (e.g., 200 OK).\n        3.  Check the darwinbox Attendance module for the recorded punch.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Attendance punch is successfully recorded in darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 2: Invalid Employee ID**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify the system handles an attendance punch with an invalid employee ID.\n    *   **Pre-conditions:**\n        *   API credentials are valid and authorized.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload with a non-existent employee ID.\n        2.  Verify the API response returns an appropriate error code (e.g., 400 Bad Request).\n        3.

Verify the error message indicates the missing field.\n        4.  Confirm that no attendance record is created in darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error, and no attendance record is created.\n\n*   **Test Case 4: Incorrect Data Format**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify the system handles an attendance punch with incorrect data format (e.g., invalid timestamp format).\n    *   **Pre-conditions:**\n        *   API credentials are valid and authorized.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload with an incorrectly formatted timestamp.\n        2.  Verify the API response returns an appropriate error code (e.g., 400 Bad Request).\n        3.  Verify the error message indicates the incorrect format.\n        4.  Confirm that no attendance record is created in darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error, and no attendance record is created.\n\n*   **Test Case 5: High Volume Punch Submission**\n\n    *   **Description:** Simulate a high volume of attendance punches to test system performance and stability.\n    *   **Pre-conditions:**\n        *   API credentials are valid and authorized.\n        *   Sufficient test data (employee IDs) available.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send a large number of attendance punches (e.g., 10,000) concurrently to the darwinbox API.\n        2.  Monitor API response times and error rates.\n        3.  Verify all attendance punches are successfully recorded in darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** All attendance punches are successfully recorded within acceptable performance parameters.\n\n*   **Test Case 6: Duplicate Punch Submission**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify the system handles duplicate attendance punch submissions.\n    *   **Pre-conditions:**\n        *   API credentials are valid and authorized.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.
