    "Integration Description and Overview": {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "*   This is an API-based inbound integration where Shopper Stop will push employee attendance punches to Darwinbox.\n*   Shopper Stop will consume Darwinbox APIs to push attendance data.\n*   **Data Flow:** INBOUND - Attendance punches flow from Shopper Stop to Darwinbox.\n*   **Business Logic:** This will be a push-based integration, ShoppersStop needs to consume Darwinbox APIs to push the attendance punches. The scope of this integration will be limited to the employee strength of 10,000 (considering that maximum 1,00,000 attendance punches will be pushed in a day)\n*   **Module:** Attendance module in Darwinbox will be updated with the attendance punches from Shopper Stop.\n*   **Authentication:** Standard API authentication methods (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) will be used to secure the integration."
