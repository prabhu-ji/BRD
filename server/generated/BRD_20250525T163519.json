      "content": "**Test Cases: Attendance Data Integration (Shoppers Stop to Darwinbox)**\n\n*   **Objective:** Validate the successful integration of attendance data from Shoppers Stop to Darwinbox via API.\n\n*   **General Test Case Requirements:**\n\n    *   All test cases must be executed in a test environment mirroring production.\n    *   Data validation should include checks for data type, format, and range.\n    *   Error handling and logging must be verified for all scenarios.\n    *   Performance testing should be conducted to ensure acceptable response times.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Successful Attendance Punch Submission**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that a valid attendance punch from Shoppers Stop is successfully created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit a valid attendance punch record via the API.\n        2.  Verify the record is created in Darwinbox with correct details.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Attendance record created successfully in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Data Elements to Validate:**\n        *   Employee ID\n        *   Punch Timestamp\n        *   Punch Type (IN/OUT)\n        *   Location\n    *   **API Endpoint:** `/attendance/punches` (Example)\n    *   **Request Payload Example:**\n        \n\n*   **Test Case 2: Invalid Employee ID**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system rejects attendance punches with invalid employee IDs.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch with an employee ID that does not exist in Darwinbox.\n        2.  Verify that the API returns an appropriate error message.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error indicating an invalid employee ID.\n    *   **Error Message Example:** \"Invalid employee ID: SS99999\"\n\n*   **Test Case 3: Missing Required Fields**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system rejects attendance punches with missing required fields.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch with a missing required field (e.g., `punchTimestamp`).\n        2.  Verify that the API returns an appropriate error message.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error indicating a missing required field.\n    *   **Error Message Example:** \"Missing required field: punchTimestamp\"\n\n*   **Test Case 4: Duplicate Attendance Punch**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system handles duplicate attendance punches appropriately.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch.\n        2.  Submit the same attendance punch again.\n        3.  Verify that the system either rejects the duplicate or updates the existing record (depending on business rules).\n    *   **Expected Result:** System handles duplicate punches according to defined business rules.\n\n*   **Test Case 5: Future Dated Punch**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system handles future dated attendance punches appropriately.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch with a future timestamp.\n        2.  Verify that the system either rejects the punch or accepts it with a warning (depending on business rules).\n    *   **Expected Result:** System handles future dated punches according to defined business rules.\n\n*   **Test Case 6: High Volume Data Load**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify the system's performance under high volume data load.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit 100,000 attendance punches within a short timeframe.\n        2.  Monitor system performance (response times, CPU usage, memory usage).\n    *   **Expected Result:** System maintains acceptable performance levels under high volume load.\n\n*   **Test Case 7: Data Type Validation**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system validates data types correctly.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch with an incorrect data type (e.g., string for `punchTimestamp`).\n        2.  Verify that the API returns an appropriate error message.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error indicating an invalid data type.\n    *   **Error Message Example:** \"Invalid data type for punchTimestamp: expected datetime\"\n\n*   **Test Case 8: Time Zone Handling**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the system correctly handles time zone conversions.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit attendance punches from different time zones.\n        2.  Verify that the timestamps are correctly converted and stored in Darwinbox's time zone.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Timestamps are correctly converted and stored.\n\n*   **Test Case 9: API Authentication**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API authentication mechanism is working correctly.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch with invalid credentials.\n        2.  Verify that the API returns an authentication error.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an authentication error.\n\n*   **Test Case 10: API Rate Limiting**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API rate limiting is working correctly.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Submit a large number of requests in a short period of time.\n        2.  Verify that the API returns a rate limiting error after exceeding the limit.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns a rate limiting error."
