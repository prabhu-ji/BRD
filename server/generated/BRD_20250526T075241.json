      "content": "Technical Design Specifications\n\n**1. Purpose/Overview**\n\n*   This document outlines the technical specifications for an API-based inbound integration between Shopper Stop and Darwinbox.\n*   The integration will facilitate the transfer of employee attendance data from Shopper Stop to Darwinbox.\n*   Shopper Stop will use this biometric data for payroll and performance management within Darwinbox.\n\n**2. APIs Used**\n\n*   Darwinbox Attendance API will be consumed by Shopper Stop.\n*   Specific endpoints include:\n    *   `/attendance/v1/punches`: For pushing attendance punches.\n*   Authentication: API Key-based authentication will be used.\n\n**3. Technical Specifications**\n\n*   **Integration Mode:** API-Based, INBOUND (Shopper Stop to Darwinbox)\n*   **Data Format:** JSON\n*   **Transport Protocol:** HTTPS\n*   **Architecture:**\n    *   Shopper Stop system will push attendance punches to Darwinbox via the `/attendance/v1/punches` API endpoint.\n    *   Darwinbox will receive and process the data, updating the Attendance module.\n*   **Data Transformation:** Data mapping will be required to transform Shopper Stop's attendance data format to Darwinbox's expected format.\n*   **Error Handling:**\n    *   Shopper Stop will implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls.\n    *   Darwinbox will provide detailed error responses for troubleshooting.\n*   **Rate Limiting:** Darwinbox will enforce rate limits to ensure system stability. Shopper Stop should be aware of and adhere to these limits.\n\n**4. Data Mapping**\n\n*   The following data fields will be mapped:\n    *   Employee ID (Shopper Stop) to Employee ID (Darwinbox)\n    *   Punch In Time (Shopper Stop) to Check-In Time (Darwinbox)\n    *   Punch Out Time (Shopper Stop) to Check-Out Time (Darwinbox)\n    *   Location (Shopper Stop) to Location (Darwinbox)\n\n**5. Security Considerations**\n\n*   API Key will be securely stored and managed by Shopper Stop.\n*   All data transmitted over HTTPS will be encrypted.\n\n**6. Performance Requirements**\n\n*   The integration should be able to handle up to 100,000 attendance punches per day.\n*   API response times should be less than 2 seconds.\n\n**7. Dependencies/Assumptions**\n\n*   Shopper Stop's system must be able to connect to the Darwinbox API endpoint over HTTPS.\n*   Shopper Stop's employee IDs must match the employee IDs in Darwinbox.\n*   The Darwinbox Attendance module must be configured to accept external attendance data.\n*   The scope of this integration will be limited to the employee strength of 10,000.\n\n**8. Monitoring and Logging**\n\n*   Shopper Stop will log all API requests and responses.\n*   Darwinbox will monitor the API endpoint for performance and errors."
