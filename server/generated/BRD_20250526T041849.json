      "content": "**Test Cases: Attendance Data Integration (Shoppers Stop to Darwinbox)**\n\n*   **Objective:** Validate the successful integration of attendance data from Shoppers Stop to Darwinbox via API.\n\n*   **General Test Case Requirements:**\n\n    *   All test cases must be executed in a test environment mirroring production.\n    *   Data validation should include checks for data type, format, and range.\n    *   Error handling and logging must be verified for all scenarios.\n    *   Performance testing should be conducted to ensure acceptable response times.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Successful Attendance Punch Submission**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that a valid attendance punch from Shoppers Stop is successfully recorded in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Steps:**\n\n        1.  Submit a valid attendance punch via the API with required fields (Employee ID, Timestamp, Punch Type).\n        2.  Verify that the API returns a success response (HTTP 200 OK).\n        3.  Confirm that the attendance record is created in Darwinbox with correct details.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Attendance record created successfully in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 2: Invalid Employee ID**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API rejects attendance punches with invalid Employee IDs.\n    *   **Steps:**\n\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch with an Employee ID that does not exist in Darwinbox.\n        2.  Verify that the API returns an error response (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n        3.  Confirm that the error message indicates an invalid Employee ID.\n        4.  Verify that no attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error, and no record is created.\n\n*   **Test Case 3: Missing Required Fields**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API rejects attendance punches with missing required fields.\n    *   **Steps:**\n\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch without the Timestamp field.\n        2.  Verify that the API returns an error response (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n        3.  Confirm that the error message indicates the missing field.\n        4.  Verify that no attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error, and no record is created.\n\n*   **Test Case 4: Invalid Timestamp Format**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API rejects attendance punches with invalid Timestamp formats.\n    *   **Steps:**\n\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch with an invalid Timestamp format (e.g., \"12-12-2024\").\n        2.  Verify that the API returns an error response (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n        3.  Confirm that the error message indicates an invalid Timestamp format.\n        4.  Verify that no attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error, and no record is created.\n\n*   **Test Case 5: Duplicate Attendance Punch**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify the system's handling of duplicate attendance punches.\n    *   **Steps:**\n\n        1.  Submit an attendance punch.\n        2.  Submit the exact same attendance punch again.\n        3.  Verify that the system either rejects the duplicate or updates the existing record (depending on the business rule).\n        4.  If rejected, confirm the appropriate error message.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Duplicate punch is handled according to defined business rules.\n\n*   **Test Case 6: High Volume Data Load**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify the system's performance under a high volume of attendance punches.\n    *   **Steps:**\n\n        1.  Submit 100,000 attendance punches within a short timeframe.\n        2.  Monitor API response times and system resource utilization.\n        3.  Verify that all attendance records are successfully created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** System handles the load without performance degradation or data loss.\n\n*   **Test Case 7: Boundary Value Testing - Timestamp**\n\n    *   **Description:** Test the boundaries of the Timestamp field.\n    *   **Steps:**\n\n        1.  Submit a punch with a timestamp at the earliest allowed date/time.\n        2.  Submit a punch with a timestamp at the latest allowed date/time.\n        3.  Verify that both punches are processed correctly.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Punches with boundary timestamps are processed successfully.\n\n*   **Test Case 8: Error Logging and Monitoring**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that all errors are properly logged and monitored.\n    *   **Steps:**\n\n        1.  Execute test cases that generate errors (e.g., invalid Employee ID).\n        2.  Check the system logs for error messages.\n        3.  Verify that the monitoring system alerts on errors.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Errors are logged and monitored as expected."
