Send a valid attendance punch payload to the Darwinbox API endpoint.\n        2.  Verify the API response code is 200 (OK) or 201 (Created).\n        3.  Check the response body for a success message and the Darwinbox attendance record ID.\n        4.  Verify the attendance record is created in Darwinbox with the correct employee ID, punch time, and punch type.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Attendance record is successfully created in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 2: Invalid Employee ID**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API rejects attendance punches with invalid employee IDs.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload with an employee ID that does not exist in Darwinbox.\n        2.  Verify the API response code is 400 (Bad Request) or 404 (Not Found).\n        3.  Check the response body for an error message indicating the invalid employee ID.\n        4.  Verify that no attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error, and no attendance record is created.\n\n*   **Test Case 3: Missing Required Fields**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API rejects attendance punches with missing required fields.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload with one or more missing required fields (e.g., employee ID, punch time).\n        2.  Verify the API response code is 400 (Bad Request).\n        3.  Check the response body for an error message indicating the missing required fields.\n        4.  Verify that no attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error, and no attendance record is created.\n\n*   **Test Case 4: Invalid Punch Time Format**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API rejects attendance punches with invalid punch time formats.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload with an invalid punch time format (e.g., incorrect date format).\n        2.  Verify the API response code is 400 (Bad Request).\n        3.  Check the response body for an error message indicating the invalid punch time format.\n        4.  Verify that no attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API returns an error, and no attendance record is created.\n\n*   **Test Case 5: Duplicate Attendance Punch**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API handles duplicate attendance punches correctly (either rejects or updates).\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload.\n        2.  Send the same attendance punch payload again.\n        3.  Verify the API response code for the second request (should be either 200/201 if updating or 409 Conflict if rejecting).\n        4.  Verify the behavior in Darwinbox (either the existing record is updated, or a duplicate is not created).\n    *   **Expected Result:** API handles duplicate punches according to the defined business logic.\n\n*   **Test Case 6: High Volume Testing**\n\n    *   **Description:** Simulate a high volume of attendance punches to assess API performance and stability.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send 100,000 attendance punch payloads within a short timeframe.\n        2.  Monitor API response times and error rates.\n        3.  Verify that all attendance records are successfully created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API handles the high volume of requests without significant performance degradation or errors.\n\n*   **Test Case 7: Boundary Value Testing**\n\n    *   **Description:** Test the API with boundary values for data fields (e.g., maximum length of employee ID).\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload with an employee ID at the maximum allowed length.\n        2.  Send an attendance punch payload with an employee ID exceeding the maximum allowed length.\n        3.  Verify the API response codes and error messages.\n        4.  Verify the behavior in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API handles boundary values correctly, rejecting invalid data and accepting valid data.\n\n*   **Test Case 8: Time Zone Handling**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API correctly handles time zones for attendance punches.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send attendance punch payloads with different time zones.\n        2.  Verify that the punch times are correctly converted and stored in Darwinbox's time zone.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Punch times are accurately converted and stored in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 9: API Authentication and Authorization**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API requires proper authentication and authorization.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload without proper authentication credentials.\n        2.  Verify the API response code is 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden).\n        3.  Send an attendance punch payload with valid authentication credentials but insufficient authorization.\n        4.  Verify the API response code is 403 (Forbidden).\n    *   **Expected Result:** API requires and enforces proper authentication and authorization.\n\n*   **Test Case 10: Data Type Validation**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API validates data types for each field.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch payload with incorrect data types (e.g., string for a numeric field).\n        2.  Verify the API response code is 400 (Bad Request).\n        3.  Check the response body for an error message indicating the data type mismatch.\n        4.  Verify that no attendance record is created in Darwinbox.\n    *   **Expected Result:** API validates data types and rejects invalid data."
