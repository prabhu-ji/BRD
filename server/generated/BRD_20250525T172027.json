      "content": "**Test Cases: Shoppers Stop - Darwinbox Attendance Integration**\n\n*   **Test Case Category:** API Integration Testing\n\n*   **Objective:** Validate the successful integration of Shoppers Stop's attendance data into Darwinbox via API.\n\n*   **General Test Case Requirements:**\n\n    *   All test cases must be executed in a dedicated test environment.\n    *   Test data must be representative of real-world Shoppers Stop employee attendance data.\n    *   Each test case must include clear steps, expected results, and actual results.\n    *   All test cases must be documented with pass/fail status.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Successful Attendance Punch Ingestion**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that a single attendance punch from Shoppers Stop is successfully ingested into Darwinbox.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send a valid attendance punch record to the Darwinbox API endpoint.\n        2.  Verify the API response indicates success (HTTP 200 OK).\n        3.  Check the Darwinbox Attendance module for the employee's attendance record.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The attendance record should be accurately reflected in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 2: Failed Attendance Punch Ingestion - Invalid Employee ID**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that an attendance punch with an invalid employee ID is rejected.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch record with an invalid employee ID to the Darwinbox API endpoint.\n        2.  Verify the API response indicates an error (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n        3.  Check the Darwinbox logs for the error message.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The API should return an error, and the attendance record should not be created in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 3: Failed Attendance Punch Ingestion - Missing Required Fields**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that an attendance punch with missing required fields is rejected.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch record with missing required fields (e.g., timestamp) to the Darwinbox API endpoint.\n        2.  Verify the API response indicates an error (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n        3.  Check the Darwinbox logs for the error message.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The API should return an error, and the attendance record should not be created in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 4: High Volume Attendance Punch Ingestion**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the Darwinbox API can handle a high volume of attendance punches.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send 1000 attendance punch records to the Darwinbox API endpoint concurrently.\n        2.  Monitor the API response times and error rates.\n        3.  Check the Darwinbox Attendance module for the employee's attendance records.\n    *   **Expected Result:** All attendance records should be successfully ingested into Darwinbox within an acceptable timeframe, with minimal errors.\n\n*   **Test Case 5: Duplicate Attendance Punch Ingestion**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that duplicate attendance punches are handled correctly (either rejected or updated).\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch record to the Darwinbox API endpoint.\n        2.  Send the same attendance punch record again to the Darwinbox API endpoint.\n        3.  Check the Darwinbox Attendance module for the employee's attendance record.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Darwinbox should either reject the duplicate record or update the existing record, depending on the configured business logic.\n\n*   **Test Case 6: Attendance Punch with Future Timestamp**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that attendance punches with future timestamps are handled according to the defined business rules.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch record with a timestamp in the future to the Darwinbox API endpoint.\n        2.  Check the Darwinbox Attendance module for the employee's attendance record.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The system should handle the future timestamp according to the defined business rules (e.g., reject the record, adjust the timestamp, or accept the record).\n\n*   **Test Case 7: Attendance Punch with Past Timestamp (Outside Allowed Range)**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that attendance punches with timestamps outside the allowed past range are rejected.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch record with a timestamp significantly in the past (e.g., one year ago) to the Darwinbox API endpoint.\n        2.  Verify the API response indicates an error (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n        3.  Check the Darwinbox logs for the error message.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The API should return an error, and the attendance record should not be created in Darwinbox.\n\n*   **Test Case 8: Data Type Validation**\n\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the API validates data types correctly.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Send an attendance punch record with incorrect data types (e.g., string for a numeric field) to the Darwinbox API endpoint.\n        2.  Verify the API response indicates an error (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request).\n        3.  Check the Darwinbox logs for the error message.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The API should return an error, and the attendance record should not be created in Darwinbox."
