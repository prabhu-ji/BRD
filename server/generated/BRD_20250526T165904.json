      "content": "**Technical Design Specifications**\n\n**1. Purpose/Overview**\n\n*   This document outlines the technical specifications for an API-based outbound integration from Darwinbox to HR Term Bot for Visteon.\n*   The integration facilitates the transfer of active and inactive employee master data.\n*   This data will be used by Visteon for HR Term Bot functionalities.\n\n**2. APIs Used**\n\n*   Darwinbox Employee Data API (Specific endpoint details to be defined based on Darwinbox API documentation).\n    *   Method: `GET` (for retrieving employee data).\n    *   Authentication: API Key / OAuth 2.0 (Specific method to be determined).\n*   SFTP API (for secure data transfer).\n    *   Method: `PUT` (for transferring the data file).\n    *   Authentication: SSH Key-based authentication.\n\n**3. Data Mapping**\n\n*   Employee ID (Darwinbox) -> Employee ID (HR Term Bot)\n*   First Name (Darwinbox) -> First Name (HR Term Bot)\n*   Last Name (Darwinbox) -> Last Name (HR Term Bot)\n*   Date of Joining (Darwinbox) -> Date of Joining (HR Term Bot)\n*   Date of Exit (Darwinbox) -> Date of Exit (HR Term Bot)\n*   Employee Status (Darwinbox) -> Employee Status (HR Term Bot)\n*   Attendance Data (Darwinbox) -> Attendance Data (HR Term Bot)\n\n**4. Technical Specifications**\n\n*   Integration Mode: API-Based Outbound.\n*   Data Format: CSV/JSON (Predefined format agreed upon by Darwinbox and Visteon).\n*   Transfer Protocol: SFTP with encryption.\n*   Data Filtering:\n    *   Active Employees: All active employee records will be included.\n    *   Inactive Employees: Only inactive employee records with a date of exit on or after January 1, 2020, will be included.\n*   Scheduling: Scheduled data transfer (Frequency to be determined based on Visteon's requirements).\n*   Error Handling:\n    *   Logging: Detailed logging of all integration activities, including errors.\n    *   Retry Mechanism: Automatic retry mechanism for failed API calls and SFTP transfers.\n    *   Alerting: Notifications to the Darwinbox integration team for critical errors.\n\n**5. Security Considerations**\n\n*   Data Encryption: Data will be encrypted during transit using SFTP.\n*   Access Control: Access to the SFTP server will be restricted to authorized personnel only.\n*   API Key Management: Secure storage and management of API keys.\n\n**6. Dependencies/Assumptions**\n\n*   Darwinbox Employee Data API is available and accessible.\n*   Visteon's SFTP server is configured and accessible.\n*   Predefined data format is agreed upon and implemented by both Darwinbox and Visteon.\n*   Employee data in Darwinbox is accurate and up-to-date.\n*   Successful authentication and authorization for API access.\n*   Network connectivity between Darwinbox and Visteon SFTP server.\n\n**7. Integration Flow**\n\n1.  Darwinbox scheduler triggers the data extraction process.\n2.  Darwinbox retrieves employee data from the Darwinbox Employee Data API, filtering based on the defined criteria (active employees and inactive employees with date of exit ≥ 1 Jan 2020).\n3.  Data is transformed into the predefined CSV/JSON format.\n4.  The data file is encrypted.\n5.  The encrypted file is transferred to Visteon's SFTP server using the SFTP API.\n6.  Logging and error handling are performed throughout the process."
